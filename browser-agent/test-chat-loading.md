# Chat Loading Fix Test Plan

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented fixes to resolve the chat session loading issue:

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging throughout the chat loading flow
- Improved error messages to help diagnose issues
- Added user-friendly toast notifications for errors

### 2. Fixed API Route Issues
- Properly handle Next.js 15 async params pattern
- Added validation for missing chat IDs
- Improved error response details

### 3. Improved State Management
- Added try-catch blocks for attachment processing
- Clear state on errors to prevent UI issues
- Added loading state indicators in sidebar

### 4. UI Improvements
- Added loading spinner in sidebar when chat is loading
- Disabled chat selection while loading to prevent duplicate requests
- Better visual feedback during loading

### 5. Enhanced Service Layer
- Added detailed logging in chat-persistence service
- Better error handling for database connection issues
- Graceful fallback to localStorage when persistence not configured

## Test Steps

1. **Test Loading Existing Chat**
   - Click on a chat in the sidebar
   - Should see loading spinner next to chat
   - Chat should load successfully
   - Check browser console for detailed logs

2. **Test Error Handling**
   - Try loading a non-existent chat (manually navigate to `/chat/invalid-id`)
   - Should see error toast notification
   - UI should remain functional

3. **Test Loading State**
   - Click on different chats rapidly
   - Loading state should prevent duplicate requests
   - Only one chat should load at a time

4. **Test with Different Content**
   - Load chats with images
   - Load chats with videos
   - Load chats with attachments
   - All should work without errors

## Console Logs to Check

Look for these log patterns in browser console:

```
[PAGE] Selecting chat: <chatId>
[CHAT PERSISTENCE] Loading chat: <chatId>
[API] GET /api/chats/[chatId] - Loading chat: <chatId>
[CHAT PERSISTENCE] Fetching chat: <chatId>
[CHAT PERSISTENCE] Found chat: <title>
[CHAT PERSISTENCE] Found X messages
[PAGE] Loaded chat data: {...}
```

## Expected Behavior

1. Chat loads successfully with all messages
2. Loading spinner shows during loading
3. Error messages are clear and helpful
4. No duplicate loading requests
5. UI remains responsive

## If Issues Persist

Check for:
1. Database connection errors
2. Invalid chat IDs
3. Corrupted message data
4. Network issues

The enhanced logging will help identify the exact point of failure.
