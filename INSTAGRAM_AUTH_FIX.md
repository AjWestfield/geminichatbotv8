# Instagram Download Fix - Authentication Issue

## Problem
The Instagram download feature was failing with "This content is private or requires authentication" error, but not properly triggering the cookie authentication UI.

## Root Cause
1. The API route was returning a 500 status code instead of 401 for authentication errors
2. The frontend was not properly detecting authentication errors to show the cookie manager
3. The GraphQL method didn't support cookie authentication

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Route Updates (`/app/api/instagram-download/route.ts`)
- Added cookie parsing function to convert Netscape format cookies to headers
- Updated GraphQL method to include cookies in request headers
- Enhanced error detection to identify authentication errors
- Return 401 status code for authentication required errors
- Improved error messages with specific status codes

### 2. Frontend Updates (`/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx`)
- Added CookieManager component import
- Added state for showing cookie manager and storing pending URL
- Updated handleInstagramDownload to accept cookies parameter
- Enhanced error handling to detect 401 errors and show cookie UI
- Added callbacks for cookie authentication flow
- Added CookieManager modal to component render

### 3. Utils Updates (`/lib/instagram-url-utils.ts`)
- Updated downloadInstagramMedia to properly detect 401 errors
- Create proper error object with authentication status
- Pass authentication errors to frontend correctly

## How It Works Now

1. User pastes Instagram URL
2. System attempts to download without authentication
3. If content requires authentication:
   - API returns 401 status with authentication error
   - Frontend detects 401 and shows CookieManager modal
   - User provides Instagram cookies
   - System retries download with cookies
   - Content downloads successfully

## Cookie Format
The system accepts cookies in Netscape format (from browser extensions like "Get cookies.txt"):
```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
.instagram.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1234567890	sessionid	value123
.instagram.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1234567890	csrftoken	value456
```

## Testing
1. Try downloading a private Instagram reel/post
2. When authentication error appears, click "Provide Cookies"
3. Paste Instagram cookies from logged-in session
4. Download should complete successfully

## Status
âœ… Fixed and ready for testing
