# Comparison Slider Implementation for Image Edit Modal

## Overview
Added a comparison slider feature to the Image Edit Modal that allows users to preview their edits before applying them. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback on how their edit prompt will transform the image.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Component: `/components/image-edit-modal.tsx`

#### New State Variables:
- `showComparison: boolean` - Toggles the comparison view on/off
- `comparisonMode: 'split' | 'slider'` - Switches between split screen and slider modes
- `sliderPosition: number` - Tracks the slider handle position (0-100)
- `sliderContainerRef: React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>` - Reference for updating CSS custom properties

#### New Imports:
- Added `useRef` from React
- Added `Eye`, `SplitSquareHorizontal` icons from lucide-react
- Added `cn` utility from lib/utils

#### New Features:
1. **Comparison Toggle Button**: Shows/hides the comparison view
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose between Split and Slider comparison modes
3. **Split View**: Side-by-side display of original and preview
4. **Slider View**: Interactive before/after slider with draggable handle
5. **Touch Support**: Full support for mobile devices
6. **CSS Integration**: Reuses existing comparison slider styles from `app/globals.css`

## User Experience

### How to Use:
1. Open the Image Edit Modal with any image
2. Click "Show Comparison" button in the preview section
3. Choose between "Split" or "Slider" mode:
   - **Split Mode**: Shows original and preview side by side
   - **Slider Mode**: Drag the handle to reveal more of either image
4. The preview area shows a placeholder until an actual edit preview is generated

### Visual Feedback:
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Visual indicators for "Original" and "After Edit"
- Interactive slider handle with hover effects
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Custom Properties:
The slider uses CSS custom properties for dynamic positioning:
- `--slider-position`: Controls handle position (0-100%)
- `--clip-right`: Controls how much of the overlay is visible

### Event Handling:
- Mouse events for desktop interaction
- Touch events for mobile devices
- Click anywhere on the slider to jump to that position
- Drag the handle for fine control

### Performance:
- Uses `transform` and `clip-path` for hardware acceleration
- Minimal re-renders with proper event handling
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Code Quality

### Reusability:
- Reuses existing CSS classes from the image gallery implementation
- Consistent with the app's design patterns
- No duplicate code - leverages existing styles

### Maintainability:
- Clear component structure
- Well-documented with comments
- Follows TypeScript best practices
- Consistent naming conventions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. **Live Preview**: Generate preview as user types their edit prompt
2. **Multiple Variations**: Compare different edit options
3. **Zoom Functionality**: Zoom in for detailed comparison
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick toggle between modes
5. **Save Comparisons**: Export comparison screenshots

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Generate or upload an image
3. Click the Edit button on any image
4. Toggle the comparison view
5. Test both Split and Slider modes
6. Verify touch support on mobile devices
