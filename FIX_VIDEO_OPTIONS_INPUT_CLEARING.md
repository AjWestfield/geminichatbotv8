# Video/Image Options Input Clearing Fix

## Problem
After selecting a video analysis option (like "Reverse Engineer This Video") or image analysis option, the original video URL or file reference remained in the chat input field after the analysis was submitted.

## Solution
Added explicit input clearing after submission for all media analysis options:

### Fixed Options:
1. **Video Analysis** - "Analyze & Transcribe" option
2. **Video Reverse Engineering** - "Reverse Engineer" option  
3. **Image Analysis** - "Analyze this image" option
4. **Image Animation** - "Animate this image" option

### Technical Implementation:
Added a nested `setTimeout` after `originalHandleSubmit` to clear the input:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  handleInputChange({ target: { value: '' } } as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)
}, 50)
```

### Files Modified:
- `components/chat-interface.tsx` - Updated `handleChatVideoOptionSelect` and `handleChatImageOptionSelect` functions

## Result
Now when you select any media analysis option:
1. The appropriate analysis prompt is inserted
2. The prompt is submitted automatically
3. The input field is cleared after submission âœ…

This provides a cleaner user experience where the input field is ready for the next prompt after selecting an analysis option.
