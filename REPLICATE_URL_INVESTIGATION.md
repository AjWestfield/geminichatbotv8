# Replicate URL 404 Investigation

## Problem Summary
User reported that a Replicate image URL returned 404 when trying to edit, even though the image was generated just minutes ago. This contradicts the expected 24-hour validity period for Replicate URLs.

## Key Findings

### 1. URL Pattern Analysis
The failing URL: `https://replicate.delivery/xezq/f6SaVQIcou0raqwA0LJGILFzK31PUQyfpOsobKduT4BrGx4UA/tmph82l0jop.jpg`

Notable aspects:
- Contains `tmp` in the filename (`tmph82l0jop.jpg`), suggesting a temporary file
- Standard Replicate delivery URL format
- Should be valid for 24 hours according to documentation

### 2. Current Implementation Issues

#### Blob Storage Not Configured
If `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is not set:
- The system returns the original Replicate URL instead of uploading to permanent storage
- This leaves users vulnerable to URL expiration

#### Immediate 404 Errors
The core issue is that some Replicate URLs are returning 404 immediately after generation, not after 24 hours.

### 3. Possible Root Causes

1. **Replicate API Issue**: The API might be returning URLs that are already invalid or cleaned up too quickly
2. **Model-Specific Issue**: Certain models (flux-kontext-max) might have different URL handling
3. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Files with `tmp` in the name might be cleaned up more aggressively
4. **Rate Limiting**: Replicate might invalidate URLs if accessed too frequently

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix
1. **Always validate URLs** immediately after generation
2. **Retry with data URL conversion** if validation fails
3. **Provide clear error messages** about the actual issue (not just "expired after 24 hours")

### Long-term Fix
1. **Enforce blob storage configuration** for production use
2. **Implement automatic retry** with different generation parameters
3. **Cache generated images locally** for immediate access
4. **Monitor Replicate API status** for service issues

## Implementation Changes Made

1. Added immediate URL validation after generation
2. Enhanced error messages to be more accurate
3. Added detailed logging to track URL lifecycle
4. Implemented automatic blob upload for new images
5. Created migration script for existing images

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate images with different Replicate models
2. Immediately try to edit them
3. Check if specific models or prompts cause immediate 404s
4. Monitor the logs for URL validation failures

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Replicate Support** if immediate 404s continue
2. **Implement local caching** as a fallback
3. **Consider alternative image generation APIs** for redundancy
4. **Add monitoring** for Replicate URL validity rates
