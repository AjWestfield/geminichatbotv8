# MCP Removal Complete - January 3, 2025

## What Was Removed

Successfully removed all MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and instructions from the AI agent.

### Changes Made:

1. **Cleared MCP Configuration** (`mcp.config.json`):
   - Removed all servers from the configuration
   - Set `servers` to empty array `[]`

2. **Disabled MCP System Prompt** (`lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`):
   - Modified `generateSystemPrompt()` to return empty string
   - Commented out all MCP instruction generation code
   - Added note: "MCP system prompt generation disabled"

3. **Disabled MCP in Chat Route** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):
   - Replaced MCP tools loading with empty context
   - Set `toolsContext = { tools: [], systemPrompt: '' }`
   - Prevents any MCP-related processing

## Result

- No MCP servers will be loaded or connected
- No MCP instructions will be sent to the AI
- The AI will not have access to any MCP tools
- No automatic acknowledgment messages will appear

## To Re-enable MCP (if needed in future)

1. Add servers back to `mcp.config.json`
2. Uncomment the code in `generateSystemPrompt()` method
3. Restore the `MCPToolsContext.getAvailableTools()` call in chat route

## Testing

After restarting the app:
- Verify no MCP-related messages appear
- Confirm AI functions normally without MCP tools
- Check that no auto-acknowledgment occurs

The AI agent is now completely free of MCP functionality and instructions.
