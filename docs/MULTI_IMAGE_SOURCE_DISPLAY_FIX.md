# Multi-Image Source Display Fix

## Issue Description
The source images in the multi-image comparison view were showing black spaces on the top and bottom, making the interface look unprofessional and wasting screen space.

## Root Cause
The source images were using `object-contain` CSS property, which preserves the aspect ratio but creates black letterboxing/pillarboxing to fill the container dimensions.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Changed object-fit from `object-contain` to `object-cover`**
   - This makes images fill their containers completely
   - May slightly crop edges but eliminates black spaces
   - Provides a much cleaner, professional look

2. **Added wrapper div for better image containment**
   - Wrapped img in a relative positioned div
   - Ensures proper sizing and positioning

3. **Updated grid layout**
   - Added `auto-rows-fr` to make rows equal height
   - Removed duplicate `bg-black` class
   - Grid adjusts based on number of images:
     - 2 images: 1 column
     - 3-4 images: 2 columns
     - 5-6 images: 2 columns
     - 7+ images: 3 columns

## Files Modified
- `/components/image-gallery.tsx` (lines ~1103-1164)

## Benefits
1. **No more black spaces** - Images fill containers completely
2. **Better visual consistency** - All source images display uniformly
3. **Improved aesthetics** - Cleaner, more professional appearance
4. **Responsive design** - Adapts to different numbers of source images
5. **Maintains functionality** - Click to view, hover effects, error handling all preserved

## Testing
1. Open the app and generate a multi-image edit
2. Click on the generated image to open comparison view
3. Check the source images on the right side
4. Verify no black spaces appear above/below images
5. Test with different numbers of source images (2, 4, 6+)
6. Run `test-multi-image-display-fix.js` in browser console for automated checks

## Before vs After
- **Before**: Images had black bars with `object-contain`, wasted space
- **After**: Images fill containers with `object-cover`, clean appearance

## Additional Notes
- Images may be slightly cropped at edges to fill containers
- This is standard practice in modern UIs (Instagram, Pinterest, etc.)
- Aspect ratios are still respected within the crop
- Original full images can still be viewed by clicking on them
