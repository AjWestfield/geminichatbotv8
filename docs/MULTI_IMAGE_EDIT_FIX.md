# Multi-Image Edit Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The WaveSpeed multi-image edit feature was failing with "Unknown error" messages. The root cause was:
1. Expired/invalid Replicate URLs (0.09KB file sizes)
2. Poor error message extraction from WaveSpeed API responses
3. No validation of HTTP image URLs before sending to API

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`lib/wavespeed-multi-client.ts`)
- Added comprehensive error logging to capture full API responses
- Improved error message extraction checking multiple response fields
- Added debugging output for failed tasks

### 2. Image URL Validation (`lib/wavespeed-multi-client.ts`)
- Made `validateImages` async to check URL accessibility
- Added HEAD request validation for HTTP URLs
- Added file size validation (warns if < 1KB)
- Logs content type and size for each validated image

### 3. Image Conversion (`app/api/edit-multi-image/route.ts`)
- Converts HTTP URLs to base64 data URLs before sending to WaveSpeed
- Prevents issues with expired/temporary URLs
- Logs conversion details for debugging

### 4. Polling Improvements (`lib/wavespeed-multi-client.ts`)
- Implemented exponential backoff (1s → 1.5s → 2.25s... max 10s)
- Better handles temporary API issues

### 5. Feature Flag Support (`app/api/edit-multi-image/route.ts`)
- Added `DISABLE_WAVESPEED_MULTI_IMAGE` environment variable
- Allows quick disabling if issues persist

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-multi-image-fix.js
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Generic "Unknown error" messages
- No indication of why images failed
- Continuous polling with same error

### After Fix
- Specific error messages (e.g., "Image 1 URL is not accessible (HTTP 404)")
- Full error details in console logs
- Automatic conversion of valid HTTP URLs to base64
- Better handling of API failures

## Next Steps

1. Monitor logs for actual WaveSpeed error messages
2. Ensure users upload fresh images (not expired URLs)
3. Consider implementing client-side image validation
4. Add retry UI for failed attempts

## Environment Variables

- `WAVESPEED_API_KEY`: Required for API access
- `DISABLE_WAVESPEED_MULTI_IMAGE`: Set to 'true' to disable feature

## Debugging

Check console logs for:
- `[API]` - API route processing
- `[WaveSpeed Multi]` - Client operations
- `[WaveSpeed DEBUG]` - Detailed debugging info

## Common Issues

1. **Expired URLs**: Replicate URLs expire quickly. Solution: Images are now converted to base64
2. **Small files**: 0.09KB images are likely placeholders. Solution: Size validation added
3. **Network issues**: Temporary failures. Solution: Exponential backoff implemented
