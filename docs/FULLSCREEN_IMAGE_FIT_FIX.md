# Fullscreen Image Fit Fix - Multi-Image Comparison

## Issue
When viewing the multi-image comparison modal in fullscreen mode, images with the "Result" tag were being cut off. This was particularly noticeable with portrait or non-standard aspect ratio images.

## Root Cause
The images were using `object-cover` CSS class which crops images to fill their container, causing parts of the image to be cut off when the aspect ratio didn't match the container.

## Solution
Changed image display properties from `object-cover` to `object-contain` to ensure the entire image is always visible regardless of aspect ratio.

### Changes Made:

1. **Result Image** (line ~1069):
   ```css
   - className="w-full h-full object-cover"
   + className="w-full h-full object-contain"
   ```

2. **Source Images** (line ~1127):
   ```css
   - className="w-full h-full object-cover"
   + className="w-full h-full object-contain"
   ```

3. **Added Background Colors**:
   - Result container: Added `bg-black` class
   - Source containers: Added `bg-black` class
   
   This ensures any empty space around the fitted image has a clean black background.

## Benefits
- Images are never cut off in fullscreen mode
- All aspect ratios display correctly
- Entire image is always visible
- Professional appearance with black background for letterboxing/pillarboxing

## Testing
Test with various aspect ratios:
- Square images (1:1)
- Portrait images (9:16)
- Landscape images (16:9)
- Ultra-wide images (21:9)

All should now display without any cropping in both normal and fullscreen modes.
