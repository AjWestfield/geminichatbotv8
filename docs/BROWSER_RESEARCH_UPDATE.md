# Browser Research Feature - Implementation Update

## Issue Analysis

The WebSocket error occurs because the browser-use service (running on port 8002) doesn't provide WebSocket streaming or real-time screenshots. It's a task-based API that:

1. Accepts a query/task via POST to `/api/browser-use/start`
2. Executes the browser automation task
3. Returns the results when complete

## Current Status

✅ **Working:**
- browser-use service is running on port 8002
- Sessions can be created successfully
- API endpoints are accessible

❌ **Not Working:**
- WebSocket connection (service doesn't support it)
- Real-time screenshot streaming
- Live browser view

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Task-Based UI (Recommended)
Modify the UI to show task progress instead of live browser view:
- Show "Research in progress..." message
- Display results when task completes
- Remove WebSocket/streaming expectations

### Option 2: Use Different Browser Service
The browser-agent service (port 8001) might support streaming, but it's not currently configured in the dev script.

### Option 3: Implement Polling with Screenshots
Modify browser-use service to capture and serve screenshots periodically.

## Quick Fix Applied

I've updated the code to:
1. Remove WebSocket connection attempts
2. Implement polling for session status
3. Handle browser-use service responses properly

## To Test

1. Refresh your browser
2. Click the research button
3. Enter a research query
4. The UI should show progress without WebSocket errors

## Next Steps

To fully fix the browser view functionality, we need to either:
1. Accept that browser-use doesn't provide live view and update UI accordingly
2. Switch to a different browser automation service that supports streaming
3. Enhance browser-use service to capture and serve screenshots

The current implementation prevents the WebSocket error but won't show live browser screenshots until one of these approaches is implemented.
