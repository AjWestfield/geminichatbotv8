# Image Gallery Placement Fix - June 21, 2025

## Issue
When generating images, the placeholder would appear at the top but the completed image would jump to the bottom of the gallery instead of replacing the placeholder in its position.

## Root Cause
Images were being added to the END of the array (`[...existingImages, newImage]`) instead of the BEGINNING.

## Solution
Updated all image addition logic to add new images at the BEGINNING of the array:
- `[newImage, ...existingImages]` instead of `[...existingImages, newImage]`

## Changes Made

### 1. Placeholder Addition (Line ~4342)
```javascript
// Before:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([...generatedImages, placeholderImage])

// After:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([placeholderImage, ...generatedImages])
```

### 2. Generated Images Without Placeholder (Lines ~4514, ~4584)
```javascript
// Before:
onGeneratedImagesChange([...generatedImages, ...newImages])

// After:
onGeneratedImagesChange([...newImages, ...generatedImages])
```

### 3. Edited Images (Lines ~4632, ~4693)
```javascript
// Before:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([...generatedImages, editedImage])

// After:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([editedImage, ...generatedImages])
```

### 4. Uploaded Images (Lines ~2841, ~3306, ~3974, ~4665)
```javascript
// Before:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([...generatedImages, uploadedImage])

// After:
onGeneratedImagesChange?.([uploadedImage, ...generatedImages])
```

## Result
- ✅ Placeholders now appear at the top of the gallery
- ✅ Generated images replace placeholders in the same position
- ✅ All new content (generated, uploaded, edited) appears at the beginning
- ✅ Consistent user experience - newest content always appears first

## Testing
1. Generate an image - placeholder should appear at the top
2. Wait for completion - image should replace placeholder in same position
3. Upload an image - should appear at the top
4. Edit an image - edited version should appear at the top
