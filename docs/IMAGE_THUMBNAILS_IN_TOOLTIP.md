# Image Thumbnails in Chat Sidebar Tooltip

## Overview
This feature adds image thumbnails to the chat sidebar tooltip, allowing users to see a visual preview of images in each chat when hovering over it.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
The `chat_summaries` view has been enhanced to include image thumbnails:
- Added `image_thumbnails` column containing first 6 images from each chat
- Returns JSON array with id, url, and prompt for each image
- Ordered by most recent images first

**To apply database changes:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the script: `scripts/database/add-image-thumbnails-to-chat-summaries.sql`

### 2. TypeScript Interface Update
Enhanced `ChatSummary` interface in `lib/database/supabase.ts`:
```typescript
image_thumbnails?: Array<{
  id: string
  url: string
  prompt: string
}>
```

### 3. UI Changes
Updated `ChatListItem` component in `app-sidebar.tsx`:
- Added "Recent Images" section to tooltip
- Displays up to 6 thumbnails in a 3x2 grid
- Shows "+X more images" if chat has more than 6 images
- Handles broken/expired image URLs gracefully
- Includes hover effect for better interactivity

## Features
- **Performance**: Limited to 6 thumbnails to keep tooltips lightweight
- **Error Handling**: Broken images show a placeholder icon
- **Responsive**: Grid layout adapts to content
- **Visual Feedback**: Subtle zoom effect on hover
- **Accessibility**: Includes alt text from image prompts

## User Experience
When hovering over a chat in the sidebar:
1. Tooltip appears with chat details
2. If chat has images, thumbnails appear below stats
3. Up to 6 most recent images are shown
4. Indicator shows if there are more images
5. Each thumbnail can be hovered for a subtle zoom effect

## Performance Considerations
- Images lazy load to prevent blocking
- Thumbnails are fetched with chat list (no additional API calls)
- Limited to 6 images to maintain fast tooltip rendering
- Graceful fallback for expired/broken URLs
