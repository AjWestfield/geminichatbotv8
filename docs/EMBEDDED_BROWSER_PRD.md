# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Embedded Browser View for Deep Research Feature

### 1. Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing an embedded browser view within the GeminiChatbotV7 web application. The feature will enable users to view real-time browser automation during deep research tasks without opening external browser windows.

### 2. Problem Statement
**Current State:**
- Deep research feature opens external browser windows (about:blank)
- Users cannot see what the AI agent is doing during research
- Poor user experience with disconnected browser sessions
- WebSocket connection fails to establish proper streaming

**Desired State:**
- Browser automation visible within the Canvas view of the web app
- Real-time streaming of browser activity
- Seamless integration with existing deep research functionality
- No external windows or applications required

### 3. Goals and Objectives
**Primary Goals:**
1. Display browser automation within the web app interface
2. Provide real-time visibility of AI research activities
3. Maintain security and performance standards

**Success Metrics:**
- Latency: < 100ms for frame updates
- Frame rate: Minimum 15 FPS, target 30 FPS
- Stability: Support 30+ minute research sessions
- User satisfaction: 90%+ positive feedback

### 4. User Stories

### 7. Technical Architecture

#### 7.1 Components
1. **Browser Stream Service** (Python/FastAPI)
   - Playwright integration
   - CDP frame capture
   - WebSocket server
   
2. **Enhanced Browser Agent** (Python)
   - Browser-use library integration
   - Claude Sonnet 4 LLM
   - Research orchestration

3. **Canvas Renderer** (React/TypeScript)
   - WebSocket client
   - Canvas rendering
   - User interaction handling

4. **API Layer** (Next.js)
   - Session management
   - Authentication
   - Progress tracking

#### 7.2 Data Flow
1. User initiates deep research → API creates session
2. Browser agent starts → CDP captures frames
3. Frames stream via WebSocket → Canvas renders
4. User interactions → WebSocket → Browser automation
5. Research completes → Results returned to chat

### 8. UI/UX Design

#### 8.1 Canvas View Layout
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Canvas Tab                                      |
