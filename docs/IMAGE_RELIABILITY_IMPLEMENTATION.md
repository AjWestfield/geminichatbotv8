# Image Reliability Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive image reliability system implemented to ensure images always load in the application, even when original URLs expire or become inaccessible.

## Problem Solved
- **Expiring URLs**: Replicate URLs expire after 24 hours
- **Poor Error Handling**: Errors were not properly logged
- **No Fallback Strategy**: When images failed, users saw broken images
- **Lost Images**: No permanent backup of generated images

## Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Fixed error logging in `image-gallery.tsx` to properly serialize error details
- Now captures comprehensive error information including URL type, timestamp, and error context

### 2. Smart Image Loading Hook (`useImageLoader`)
Located in `hooks/use-image-loader.ts`, this hook implements a multi-strategy approach:

1. **Original URL**: First attempts to load the original URL
2. **Database Fallback**: Checks for alternative URLs in the database
3. **Image Proxy**: Uses `/api/image-proxy/convert-to-data-url` for problematic URLs
4. **Permanent Storage**: Ensures image is permanently stored as last resort

Features:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Performance tracking
- Loading state management
- Error recovery

### 3. SafeImage Component
Located in `components/ui/safe-image.tsx`, this component:
- Uses the `useImageLoader` hook for intelligent loading
- Shows appropriate loading states
- Displays informative error messages
- Provides retry functionality
- Tracks performance metrics

### 4. Proactive Permanent Storage
Updated `/api/generate-image/route.ts` to:
- Automatically upload Replicate/WaveSpeed images to Vercel Blob storage
- Return permanent URLs instead of expiring ones
- Track storage status in metadata

### 5. Migration Endpoint
Created `/api/migrate-images/route.ts` to:
- Migrate existing images to permanent storage
- Check URL validity
- Support dry-run mode
- Batch process images

## Usage

### Using SafeImage Component
```tsx
import { SafeImage } from '@/components/ui/safe-image'

<SafeImage
  src={imageUrl}
  imageId={image.id}
  alt="Description"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  showLoadingState={true}
  showErrorState={true}
  enableRetry={true}
/>
```

### Migrating Existing Images
```bash
# Check specific images
curl -X POST /api/migrate-images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageIds": ["img_123", "img_456"], "dryRun": true}'

# Migrate images
curl -X POST /api/migrate-images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageIds": ["img_123", "img_456"]}'
```

## Benefits
1. **Zero Image Loss**: All images backed up to permanent storage
2. **Better Performance**: Cached images load instantly
3. **Improved UX**: Loading states instead of broken images
4. **Self-Healing**: System automatically recovers expired URLs
5. **Future-Proof**: Works with any image URL type

## Technical Details

### URL Type Detection
The system automatically detects and handles:
- Data URLs (already permanent)
- Vercel Blob URLs (permanent but validated)
- Replicate URLs (expire after 24h, auto-uploaded)
- External URLs (validated and cached)

### Performance Monitoring
- Tracks load times for all images
- Records success/failure rates
- Identifies slow-loading images
- Logs retry attempts

### Storage Strategy
- Replicate/WaveSpeed images → Immediate upload to Blob
- Failed loads → Attempt recovery via proxy
- All images → Database metadata for fallback

## Configuration
No additional configuration required. The system uses existing:
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` for Vercel Blob storage
- Database connection for metadata storage

## Monitoring
Check browser console for:
- `[SafeImage]` - Component-level loading info
- `[useImageLoader]` - Strategy attempts and results
- `[ImagePerformanceMonitor]` - Performance statistics
- `[Generate Image API]` - Permanent storage operations

## Future Enhancements
- Service worker for offline image access
- Progressive image loading (blur-up)
- Automatic image optimization
- CDN integration for global performance
