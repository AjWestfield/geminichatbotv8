# Multi-Image Edit Feature - What It Actually Does

## Overview
The Multi-Image Edit feature in geminichatbotv6 uses the **WaveSpeed Flux Kontext Max Multi** model, which is designed to create **split-screen layouts** and **side-by-side comparisons**, NOT to merge subjects into composite scenes.

## What This Feature DOES
✅ **Split-Screen Layouts**: Creates images with multiple panels showing your input images side by side
✅ **Before/After Comparisons**: Perfect for showing transformations or changes
✅ **Collages**: Arranges multiple images in a grid or layout
✅ **Visual Collections**: Groups related images together with clear separation
✅ **Side-by-Side Presentations**: Shows images next to each other for comparison

## What This Feature DOES NOT Do
❌ **Scene Compositing**: Cannot place subjects from different images into the same scene
❌ **Seamless Merging**: Will not blend or merge subjects together
❌ **Object Transfer**: Cannot move objects/people from one background to another
❌ **True Image Fusion**: Does not create unified compositions

## Example Use Cases

### Good Use Cases ✅
1. **Product Comparisons**
   - "Show both products side by side"
   - "Create a before and after comparison"

2. **Style Variations**
   - "Display all three color options in a grid"
   - "Show the different angles in a collage"

3. **Progress Documentation**
   - "Create a timeline showing the transformation"
   - "Show the step-by-step process"

### Bad Use Cases ❌
1. **Scene Compositing**
   - ❌ "Put the person from image 1 into the background of image 2"
   - ❌ "Merge these subjects into one scene"
   - ❌ "Place both people at the beach together"

2. **Object Integration**
   - ❌ "Add the hat from image 1 to the person in image 2"
   - ❌ "Combine the dress and shoes on the model"

## Technical Details
- **Model**: WaveSpeed Flux Kontext Max Multi
- **Processing Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Input**: 2-10 images
- **Output**: Single image with split-screen layout
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/edit-multi-image`

## UI Updates (June 20, 2025)
The interface has been updated to set proper expectations:
- Modal title changed to "Multi-Image Split Screen Creator"
- Added blue info box explaining the feature creates split-screen layouts only
- Updated placeholder prompts to suggest appropriate uses
- Changed button text and descriptions to match actual functionality

## Alternative Solutions for True Compositing
If you need actual scene compositing or seamless merging:
1. Use a different AI model designed for inpainting/compositing
2. Use photo editing software with layer support
3. Consider using DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion with ControlNet
4. Use professional tools like Photoshop for precise control

## Testing Script
A test script is available at `test-multi-image-prompts.js` to demonstrate how different prompts are interpreted by the model.
