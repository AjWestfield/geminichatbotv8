# Video Playback Fix - Complete Summary

## What Was Fixed

The video playback issue where clicking on uploaded videos showed "stored on Gemini AI" instead of playing has been resolved.

## Root Cause

The problem occurred because:
1. The `handleFileClick` function was prioritizing Gemini URIs over local preview URLs
2. The FilePreviewModal wasn't checking for the preview URL properly
3. Videos uploaded locally were losing their playable blob/data URLs

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **URL Priority Fix** (chat-interface.tsx)
- Changed to prioritize local `preview` URL over Gemini URI
- Now passes both URLs separately: preview for playback, Gemini URI for AI operations

### 2. **Enhanced Video Detection** (file-preview-modal.tsx)  
- Updated to check for preview URLs in the correct order
- Added better logging to track which URL is being used

### 3. **Preview URL Preservation**
- Ensured blob URLs are created correctly in `processFile`
- Added logging to verify preview URLs are being stored

## How to Test Manually

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`

2. **Upload a video file**:
   - Click the file upload button
   - Select any MP4 video file
   - Wait for upload to complete

3. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   [Upload] Setting selected file: { hasPreview: true, previewType: "data" }
   [handleFileClick] Video URLs: { previewUrl: "data:video/mp4...", hasPreview: true }
   ```

4. **Click the video thumbnail**:
   - Modal should open
   - Video player should appear with controls
   - Video should be playable (not show "stored on Gemini AI")

## Expected Behavior

### Local Video Uploads ✅
- Creates blob or data URL for preview
- Modal shows video player
- Video can be played directly

### Social Media Videos (TikTok/YouTube) ⚠️
- Only has Gemini URI (no local file)
- Modal shows "stored on Gemini AI" message
- Can still analyze/reverse engineer

## Files Changed

1. **components/chat-interface.tsx**
   - `handleFileClick` (lines 3912-3936)
   - `processFile` (lines 2162-2176)
   - Upload logging (lines 2922-2929)

2. **components/file-preview-modal.tsx**
   - Video source detection (lines 221-252)

## Test Files Created

- `test-video-playback-fix.mjs` - Manual testing script
- `tests/e2e/video-upload-playback.spec.ts` - Automated E2E test
- `VIDEO_PLAYBACK_FIX_IMPLEMENTED.md` - Detailed implementation notes

## Verification in Browser Console

When working correctly, you should see:
```javascript
[FilePreviewModal] Video source check: {
  preview: "data:video/mp4;base64,...",  // or blob URL
  finalVideoSrc: "data:video/mp4;base64,...",
  hasValidSource: true,
  isGeminiOnly: false,
  sourceType: "data"  // or "blob"
}
```

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check that preview URLs are being created during upload
3. Verify the FilePreviewModal is receiving the preview URL
4. Check browser console for any errors

The fix ensures that locally uploaded videos retain their playable URLs and can be viewed directly in the modal, while social media videos correctly show the Gemini-only message.
