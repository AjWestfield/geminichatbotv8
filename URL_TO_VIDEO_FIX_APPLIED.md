# URL to Video Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Missing URL Detection Hook** (MAIN FIX)
**File**: `components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx`
**Issue**: URL detection only worked when typing, not when value changed programmatically
**Fix**: Added missing `useEffect` that monitors `value` prop changes:
```typescript
// Monitor value changes for URL detection
useEffect(() => {
  if (value && youtubeSettings.enabled && youtubeSettings.autoDetectUrls) {
    handleTextChange(value)
  }
}, [value, youtubeSettings.enabled, youtubeSettings.autoDetectUrls, handleTextChange])
```

### 2. **Port Configuration**
**File**: `.env.local`
**Issue**: PORT was not set
**Fix**: Set `PORT=3000`

### 3. **Browser Cleanup Tool**
**File**: `quick-fix-url-video.html`
**Purpose**: Clear localStorage to remove expired file references

## How to Test

1. **Restart the server** (important for .env changes):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser storage** (removes old/expired references):
   - Open `quick-fix-url-video.html` in your browser
   - Click "Clear Storage & Fix"
   - OR run in browser console: `localStorage.clear()`

3. **Check Settings**:
   - Go to Settings → Video → YouTube Download Settings
   - Enable all options:
     - ✓ Enable YouTube Download
     - ✓ Auto-detect YouTube URLs  
     - ✓ Auto-download on paste

4. **Test with YouTube URL**:
   ```
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw
   ```
   - Copy and paste this URL
   - Should see download progress
   - Video should appear in file list

## What Was Happening

The URL detection was only triggered by the `onChange` event (when typing). When the value was set programmatically or through paste events, the `handleTextChange` function wasn't being called. The added `useEffect` now monitors the `value` prop and ensures URL detection happens whenever the value changes, regardless of how.

## Status

✅ **Backend API**: Working perfectly
✅ **URL Detection**: Fixed with new useEffect
✅ **Port Config**: Set to 3000
✅ **yt-dlp**: Up to date (v2025.6.30)

The fix is applied and should work after restarting the server!
