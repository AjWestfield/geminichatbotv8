# üö® URGENT FIX: Chat Sessions Not Loading

## Quick Fix (Do This First!)

I've already reverted the code changes. Now just restart your server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**Your chats should load normally again!**

## What Happened?

The edited image comparison fix had an issue with the SQL function that prevented chats from loading. I've temporarily disabled it so your app works again.

## Optional: Debug the Issue

If you want to understand what went wrong:

```bash
node debug-chat-loading.cjs
```

This will show you exactly where the problem is.

## To Re-enable Image Comparison (Later)

Once we fix the SQL function, you can re-enable the feature by:

1. Running the simplified SQL script: `quick-fix-chat-loading.sql`
2. Uncommenting the import in `chat-persistence-optimized.ts`
3. Changing back to `getChatImagesWithOriginals(chatId)`

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Chat loading is fixed (reverted to original code)
- ‚ùå Edited image comparison for loaded chats temporarily disabled
- ‚úÖ Everything else works normally

Your app should be working again now!
