# Image Deletion Fix Summary

## Issue
Users were experiencing an error when trying to delete images from the image tab. The error showed:
- `[ImageGallery] Delete API error: {}`
- `Error: Image not found or could not be deleted`

## Root Cause
1. The `deleteImageFromBlob` function was incomplete and not returning proper success/failure status
2. Images stored only in localStorage (when database is not configured) were not being deleted
3. The API route was returning 404 error for localStorage-only images
4. The deletion flow only worked for database-persisted images

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `deleteImageFromBlob` function in `lib/storage/blob-storage.ts`
- Now properly returns a boolean to indicate success/failure
- Added better error handling and logging
- Correctly extracts pathname from blob URLs

### 2. Updated `deleteImage` function in `lib/services/chat-persistence.ts`
- Fixed the async import issue
- Returns true when persistence is not configured to allow client-side deletion
- Better error handling for blob storage deletion

### 3. Added `deleteImageFromLocalStorage` function in `lib/image-utils.ts`
- New function to delete specific images from localStorage by ID
- Returns boolean to indicate success/failure

### 4. Updated `image-gallery.tsx` component
- Now deletes from localStorage after successful API deletion
- Saves updated images list to localStorage after deletion
- Works for both single and bulk deletion

### 5. Updated API route `/api/images/[id]/route.ts`
- Now checks if persistence is configured
- Returns success for localStorage-only deletions
- Properly handles both database and localStorage scenarios

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with database NOT configured:**
   - Start the app without database environment variables
   - Generate some test images
   - Try deleting a single image - should work
   - Try bulk deleting multiple images - should work
   - Refresh the page - deleted images should not reappear

2. **Test with database configured:**
   - Start the app with Supabase configured
   - Generate some test images
   - Try deleting a single image - should work
   - Try bulk deleting multiple images - should work
   - Images should be deleted from both database and blob storage

3. **Test error handling:**
   - Open browser console
   - Try deleting an image
   - Should see appropriate console logs
   - No errors should appear in the UI

### Using the Test Page

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test-deletion.html
2. Click buttons in order:
   - "Setup Test Data" - creates test images in localStorage
   - "Test localStorage Delete" - tests the deletion function
   - "Test API Delete" - tests the API endpoint
   - "Clear All Data" - cleans up test data

### E2E Tests

Run the automated tests:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/image-deletion.spec.ts
```

## Expected Behavior

- Single image deletion should work immediately with a success toast
- Bulk deletion should work for multiple selected images
- Deleted images should not reappear after page refresh
- Error messages should be shown if deletion fails
- Console should show detailed logs for debugging
