# YouTube Auto-Download - WORKING! âœ…

## Real Download is Now Functional

The YouTube auto-download feature is now **fully working with real yt-dlp downloads**!

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Simplified Download Logic** - Replaced complex format selection with simple yt-dlp commands
2. **Direct execSync** - Using execSync instead of yt-dlp wrapper for more control
3. **Better Fallbacks** - If specific quality fails, falls back to default

### Verified Working:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/youtube-download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw", "quality": "auto"}'

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "file": {
    "uri": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/kbb5att47k1y",
    "mimeType": "video/mp4",
    "displayName": "Me at the zoo",
    "name": "files/kbb5att47k1y",
    "sizeBytes": "604687"
  }
}
```

## How to Test in the App:

### Quick Test:
