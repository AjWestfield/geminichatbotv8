# Image Gallery Ordering Fix Summary

## Problem
When editing images, they would always appear at the top of the gallery, while newly generated images would maintain their position (replacing placeholders). This created an inconsistent user experience where edited images would jump to the beginning of the gallery.

## Root Cause
1. **Placeholders were added to the beginning** - When image generation started, placeholders were added at position 0
2. **Different handling for edits** - Edited images from chat messages were directly added to the beginning without using placeholders
3. **Inconsistent completion handlers** - Various image completion handlers (edit, upscale, multi-edit) were adding images to the beginning

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Standardized Placeholder Position** (chat-interface.tsx)
- Changed placeholder creation to add at the end instead of beginning
- Maintains chronological order as images are generated

### 2. **Updated Gallery Handlers** (image-gallery.tsx)
- Modified `onEditComplete`, `onUpscaleComplete`, `onEditComplete` (multi-edit), and `onComposeComplete` handlers
- All now check if a placeholder exists and replace it at its current position
- If no placeholder exists, images are added to the end (maintaining chronological order)

### 3. **Fixed Chat Interface Handlers** (chat-interface.tsx)
- Removed obsolete `IMAGE_EDITING_COMPLETED` handler (no longer needed with placeholders)
- Updated `handleMultiImageEditComplete` to add images at the end
- Updated `handleEditImageFromModal` to add images at the end
- Fixed image generation completion handlers to add new images at the end when no placeholder exists

### 4. **Preserved Special Cases**
- Uploaded images for editing still appear at the beginning (intentional - they are new user uploads)
- Images with existing placeholders maintain their position when replaced

## Benefits
1. **Consistent ordering** - All images maintain chronological order by default
2. **Predictable behavior** - Edited images no longer jump to the top
3. **Better UX** - Users can see their image generation/editing history in order
4. **Placeholder support** - Image editing now shows progress tracking like generation

## Files Modified
- `components/image-gallery.tsx` - Updated completion handlers
- `components/chat-interface.tsx` - Fixed placeholder position and image addition order

## Testing Recommendations
1. Generate multiple images and verify they appear in chronological order
2. Edit an image and verify it replaces the placeholder at its original position
3. Upload and edit an image - should appear at the beginning (new upload behavior)
4. Test multi-image edit and compose features
5. Verify progress tracking appears for image editing operations
