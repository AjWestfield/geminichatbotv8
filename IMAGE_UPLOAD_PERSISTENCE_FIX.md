# Image Upload Persistence Fix - Test Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a fix for the image persistence issue where uploaded images would disappear after browser refresh.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
- When you uploaded images directly to the image tab, they were saved to localStorage but not always to the database
- On page refresh, the system treated the database as the source of truth
- Images not in the database were filtered out and removed from localStorage

### The Solution:
1. **Added `handleFileUpload` function** - Properly handles file uploads with the following features:
   - Creates a new chat if none exists
   - Marks uploaded images with `isUploaded: true`
   - Saves to localStorage immediately
   - Attempts to save to database if persistence is configured
   - Shows success notifications

2. **Enhanced `loadPersistedImages` function** - Now preserves uploaded images:
   - Keeps uploaded images from localStorage even if they're not in the database
   - Only removes localStorage images that have been successfully saved to database
   - Prevents loss of uploaded images due to database save failures

## How to Test

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3000

2. **Navigate to the Images tab**:
   - Click on the "Images" tab in the right panel

3. **Upload an image**:
   - Drag and drop an image file into the image gallery
   - You should see a success toast notification
   - The image should appear in the gallery immediately

4. **Refresh the browser** (F5 or Cmd+R)

5. **Check the Images tab again**:
   - The uploaded image should still be there! âœ…

## Expected Behavior

- Uploaded images are immediately saved to localStorage
- If database persistence is configured, they're also saved to the database
- On refresh, uploaded images are preserved even if database save failed
- Images have `model: 'uploaded'` and `isUploaded: true` properties

## Debug Logs

Open the browser console (F12) to see detailed logs:
- `[PAGE] handleFileUpload called with X files`
- `[PAGE] Saved X uploaded images to localStorage`
- `[PAGE] Uploaded image saved to database: img_xxx`
- `[PAGE] Keeping uploaded images from localStorage: X`

## Code Changes

1. **Added `handleFileUpload` function** in `page.tsx`
2. **Connected it to `CanvasView` component** via `onFileUpload` prop
3. **Added `generateImageId` import** from image-utils
4. **Enhanced persistence logic** to preserve uploaded images

## Next Steps

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the image appears with `isUploaded: true` in the logs
3. Check if persistence is configured (database connection)
