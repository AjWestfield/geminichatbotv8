# YouTube Download Error Fix (HTTP 416)

## Error
```
Error: yt-dlp exited with code 1
Error details: ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 416: Requested range not satisfiable
```

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. Update yt-dlp
YouTube frequently changes their API, so yt-dlp needs regular updates:

```bash
# Update yt-dlp
brew upgrade yt-dlp
# or
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
```

### 2. Check Video Availability
The video might be:
- Age-restricted (requires login)
- Private or deleted
- Region-locked
- Copyright blocked

Try a different video URL to test:
- Public video: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

### 3. Clear yt-dlp Cache
Sometimes cached data causes issues:

```bash
# Clear yt-dlp cache
yt-dlp --rm-cache-dir
```

### 4. Test yt-dlp Directly
Test if yt-dlp works outside the app:

```bash
# Test download
yt-dlp -F "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

### 5. Use Cookies (for restricted videos)
If the video requires authentication:
1. Export cookies from your browser
2. Use the cookie manager in the app
3. Or manually test: `yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt "URL"`

## The Expired File Fix Still Works! âœ…

This download error is separate from the expired file fix. The expired file fix prevents old Gemini file references from being sent and is working correctly. This is just yt-dlp having trouble downloading the specific video.

## Next Steps
1. Try a different YouTube URL
2. Update yt-dlp if needed
3. Check if the video is publicly accessible
4. Use cookies if the video requires login
