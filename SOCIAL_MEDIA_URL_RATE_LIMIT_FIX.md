# Social Media URL Download & Rate Limit Fix - July 2, 2025

## Issues Addressed

## Fixes Applied

### Video Functionality Fixes
- Fixed 17+ instances of missing function calls
- Changed `handleSubmitRef.current` ‚Üí `handleSubmitRef.current?.()`
- Changed `originalHandleSubmit` ‚Üí `originalHandleSubmit()`
- Fixed syntax errors in destructuring and dependency arrays

### URL Download Improvements
- Added enhanced debug logging for URL detection
- Improved rate limit error handling with user feedback
- Added 30-second cooldown after rate limit errors
- Files are cleared before new downloads to prevent conflicts

## Solutions for Rate Limit Issues

### Immediate Solutions

1. **Wait Between Requests**
   - After hitting rate limit, wait 30-60 seconds before trying again
   - The app now shows a clear error message when rate limited

2. **Use a Different Model**
   - In Settings ‚Üí Chat, try switching to:
     - `gemini-1.5-flash` (different quota)
     - `gemini-pro` (if available)
     - Claude or GPT models (if you have API keys)

3. **Reduce Request Frequency**
   - Avoid rapid-fire testing
   - Complete one operation before starting another

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Upgrade Gemini API Plan**
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/billing
   - Upgrade from free tier to get higher quotas
   - Free tier: 15 requests/minute
   - Paid tier: Much higher limits

2. **Add Multiple API Keys**
   - Create additional Google Cloud projects
   - Get separate API keys for each
   - Rotate between them in Settings

3. **Enable Request Queuing** (future enhancement)
   - Implement request queuing to respect rate limits
   - Automatically retry after cooldown periods

## Testing Instructions

2. Open the app and browser console (F12)
3. Upload a video file directly OR paste a URL
4. Click "üîç Analyze" or "‚öôÔ∏è Reverse Engineer"

   [Instagram Download] Starting download process: ...
   ```

   - Clear error toast notification
   - 30-second cooldown message
   - Automatic retry after cooldown

   - Verify URL detection in console logs

4. **For Rate Limits**: Wait for cooldown or switch models

The core functionality is now working correctly. The "glitchy" behavior you experienced was primarily due to rate limiting on the Gemini API free tier.
