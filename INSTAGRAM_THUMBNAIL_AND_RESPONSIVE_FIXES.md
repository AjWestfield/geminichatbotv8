# Instagram Video Thumbnail and Responsive Layout Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Video Thumbnail Not Displaying**: Instagram downloaded videos are not showing thumbnails in the chat input despite the thumbnail being properly extracted.

2. **Chat Messages Overflowing**: Chat messages are extending beyond the chat container into the canvas area, especially when using the reverse engineer feature.

## Debugging Added

### 1. Instagram Download Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to trace thumbnail data flow:

```typescript
// In animated-ai-input.tsx
console.log('[Instagram Download] Creating file with result:', {
  hasFile: !!result.file,
  hasThumbnail: !!result.thumbnail,
  thumbnailLength: result.thumbnail?.length || 0,
  mimeType: result.file?.mimeType
})
```

### 2. File Upload Debug Logging
Enhanced logging in chat-interface.tsx to track thumbnail preservation:

```typescript
console.log('[Upload] Pre-uploaded file detected, skipping upload:', {
  fileName: file.name,
  hasGeminiFile: !!(file as any).geminiFile,
  isPreUploaded: !!(file as any).isPreUploaded,
  hasVideoThumbnail: !!(file as any).videoThumbnail,
  videoThumbnailValue: videoThumbnail,
  extractedThumbnail: (file as any).videoThumbnail?.substring(0, 50)
})
```

## Responsive Layout Fixes

### 1. Message Container Width
Updated chat-message.tsx to use more of the available space:

**Before:**
```typescript
"max-w-[95%] rounded-xl px-3 py-2 sm:px-4 sm:py-3",
"sm:max-w-[85%] md:max-w-[80%] lg:max-w-[75%]",
"overflow-x-auto"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"max-w-[98%] rounded-xl px-3 py-2 sm:px-4 sm:py-3",
"sm:max-w-[95%] md:max-w-[92%] lg:max-w-[90%]",
"overflow-hidden"
```

### 2. Content Word Breaking
Added `break-words` class to ensure long content doesn't overflow:

**Before:**
```typescript
<div className="text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap">
```

**After:**
```typescript
<div className="text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
```

## Video Thumbnail Troubleshooting Steps

To debug the thumbnail issue, please:

1. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
2. **Paste an Instagram URL** and watch for these logs:
   - `[Instagram Download] Creating file with result:`
   - `[Instagram Download] Mock file created:`
   - `[Upload] Pre-uploaded file detected:`
   - `[Upload] Setting selected file:`

3. **Check the logs for**:
   - `hasThumbnail: true`
   - `hasVideoThumbnail: true`
   - `thumbnailLength: [should be > 0]`

4. **If thumbnail data exists but doesn't display**, the issue might be:
   - The thumbnail data format (should be base64 data URL)
   - The FileUpload interface not properly passing the thumbnail
   - The rendering component not receiving the thumbnail

## Expected Behavior

1. **Instagram Video Download**:
   - Download completes
   - Video file appears in chat input
   - Thumbnail is visible on the video preview
   - Analyze/Reverse Engineer options are available

2. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Chat messages use ~90-98% of the available chat width
   - Long content wraps properly without overflow
   - Code blocks have horizontal scroll when needed
   - Messages stay within the chat container boundaries

## Next Steps

1. **For Thumbnail Issue**: 
   - Monitor console logs during Instagram download
   - Verify thumbnail data is present at each step
   - Check if thumbnail is a valid base64 data URL

2. **For Layout Issue**:
   - Test with long messages and code blocks
   - Verify messages don't overlap with canvas
   - Ensure proper word breaking for URLs and long strings

## Code Changes Summary

1. **animated-ai-input.tsx**: Added debug logging for Instagram download flow
2. **chat-interface.tsx**: Enhanced logging for file upload and thumbnail tracking
3. **chat-message.tsx**: Improved responsive width limits and added break-words class
