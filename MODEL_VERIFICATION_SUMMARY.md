# Model Verification and Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Claude Sonnet 4 File Validation
- **Updated**: `app/api/chat/claude-handler.ts`
- **Added**: Video file detection and rejection for Claude Sonnet 4 (audio files are allowed)
- **Behavior**: 
  - Audio files: ✅ Allowed and analyzed normally
  - Video files: ❌ Rejected with error message:
    ```
    Claude Sonnet 4 cannot analyze video files. Please use one of the Gemini models 
    (gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20, or gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05) 
    for video analysis and reverse engineering.
    ```

### 2. Updated Chat Route
- **Updated**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` 
- **Changed**: Now passes file parameters (fileUri, fileMimeType, multipleFiles) to Claude handler
- **Ensures**: Claude handler can properly validate uploaded files

## Current Model Support

4. **Claude Sonnet 4** ✅
   - Text generation
   - Image analysis
   - Audio analysis
   - MCP tool execution
   - ❌ Video analysis (blocked with error message)

## Verification Tests Created

1. **test-model-support.js** - Verifies model configuration consistency
2. **test-reverse-engineering-detection.js** - Tests reverse engineering pattern detection
3. **test-reverse-engineering-models.js** - End-to-end test for each model (requires API key)

## How Reverse Engineering Works

1. **Detection**: The system detects reverse engineering requests using pattern matching
2. **Model Routing**:
   - Gemini models: Process reverse engineering normally
   - Claude Sonnet 4: Rejects video files before processing
3. **File Validation**: All files go through validation (expiration check, type check)
4. **Special Instructions**: When reverse engineering is detected, special VEO 3 analysis prompts are added

## Testing the Fix

To verify everything is working:

1. **Test Claude Sonnet 4 with different file types**:
   - With video file: Should see error "Claude Sonnet 4 cannot analyze video files..."
   - With audio file: Should work normally
   - With image file: Should work normally

2. **Test Gemini models with all file types**:
   - Video files: Should work normally
   - Audio files: Should work normally
   - Image files: Should work normally
   - Reverse engineering prompts: Should trigger special analysis

3. **Test reverse engineering detection**:
   - Use phrases like "reverse engineer this", "how was this made?", etc.
   - Should trigger special reverse engineering analysis for compatible models

## Note on File Expiration

If you see errors about files not being in ACTIVE state, this is because Gemini files expire after 48 hours. This is handled by the `GeminiFileValidator` class which provides user-friendly error messages.
