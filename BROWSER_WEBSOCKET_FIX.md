# Browser WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem Summary
The browser-use service was experiencing WebSocket connection errors:
- 404 errors on `/api/browser/create-session`
- 403 Forbidden errors on WebSocket connections
- Import order issue causing logger errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Order in browser_stream_service_v2.py
- Moved logging configuration before using the logger
- This prevents "logger not defined" errors

### 2. Added Compatibility Endpoints
- Added `/ws/stream/{session_id}` WebSocket endpoint for backward compatibility
- Enhanced `/api/browser/create-session` with proper error handling
- Updated `/api/browser-use/start` to handle different request formats

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added try/catch blocks around session creation
- Added logging for all endpoint requests
- Better error messages for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Use the Test HTML File
1. Open `test-websocket-connection.html` in your browser
2. Click each test button to verify:
   - Direct WebSocket connections work
   - Session creation through Next.js API works
   - Legacy endpoints are accessible
   - Browser-use endpoints respond correctly

### Method 2: Manual Testing
1. Restart the browser-use service:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current service (Ctrl+C)
   # Start it again
   ./start-browser-use.sh
   ```

2. Start your Next.js app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In the app:
   - Click the üîç icon to activate Deep Research Mode
   - Type a research query
   - The browser should connect without errors

## Expected Behavior
- No more 404 or 403 errors in the console
- WebSocket connects successfully
- Browser automation works in Deep Research mode

## Troubleshooting
If you still see errors:
1. Make sure the browser-use service is running on port 8002
2. Check that no other service is using that port
3. Look at the browser-use service logs for detailed error messages
4. Try the test HTML file to isolate the issue
