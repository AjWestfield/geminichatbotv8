### Technical Details

#### Video Playback Fix
The video proxy now properly handles Gemini file URIs by:
1. Accepting both `url` and `uri` parameters
2. Properly detecting Gemini-hosted content
3. Streaming video with correct headers
4. Providing detailed error messages

#### Auto-Send Bug Fix
Previous implementation mistakenly called functions during checks:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect - calls the function)
if (handleSubmitRef.current?.()) { ... }

// After (correct - checks existence)
if (handleSubmitRef.current) {
  handleSubmitRef.current()
}
```

#### Database Updates
New SQL migrations ensure all required tables exist:
- `videos` - Video generation records
- `audios` - Audio files and TTS
- `social_media_cookies` - Platform authentication
- `image_source_relations` - Multi-image relationships

### Migration Guide

1. **Update Dependencies**: Run `npm install`
2. **Database Migration**: Run `npm run db:setup-all`
3. **Environment Variables**: Review `.env.example` for changes
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache to avoid conflicts
