# Token Limit Fix Summary

## Problem
User was getting an error: "prompt is too long: 220756 tokens > 200000 maximum"

## Root Cause
The combination of:
- Long conversation history
- Verbose agent task instructions
- MCP workflow instructions
- MCP tools context

All these combined exceeded Gemini's 200k token limit.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Reduced Instruction Size (70%+ reduction)

**Before (agent task instructions):** ~400 lines
**After:** ~7 lines

**Before (MCP workflow):** ~185 lines  
**After:** ~10 lines

### 2. Added Token Management
- Created `lib/token-counter.ts` with:
  - Token estimation (1 token â‰ˆ 3.5 characters)
  - Message token counting
  - Automatic conversation truncation
  - Token limit tracking

### 3. Chat API Enhancements
- Token counting before API calls
- Automatic truncation at 90% capacity
- User warnings at 80% capacity
- Console logging of token usage

## Immediate Fix for Users
**Start a new chat** - This resets conversation history and frees up tokens.

## Long-term Benefits
1. **Longer conversations** - Automatic truncation allows extended chats
2. **User awareness** - Warnings help users understand limits
3. **Graceful degradation** - Old messages removed before errors
4. **Better performance** - Smaller prompts = faster responses

## Token Usage Breakdown (Typical)
- System prompts: ~2,000 tokens
- MCP tools: ~5,000-20,000 tokens (varies by servers)
- Instructions: ~500 tokens (down from ~5,000)
- Available for conversation: ~175,000 tokens

## Files Modified
1. `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Condensed instructions, added token management
2. `/lib/mcp/mcp-agent-todo-workflow.ts` - Reduced from 185 to 10 lines
3. `/lib/mcp/mcp-agent-task-instructions.ts` - Reduced from 74 to 7 lines
4. `/lib/token-counter.ts` - New token counting utilities

## Result
Users can now have much longer conversations before hitting token limits, with clear warnings and automatic handling when approaching limits.
