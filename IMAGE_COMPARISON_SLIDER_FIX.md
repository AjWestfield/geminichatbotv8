# Image Comparison Slider Fix

## Problem
The image comparison slider wasn't working - the CSS styles for the slider functionality were missing from the main stylesheet.

## Root Cause
The image comparison CSS styles were defined in `styles/globals.css` but this file wasn't being imported into the main `app/globals.css` file that Next.js uses.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Image Comparison CSS (app/globals.css)
Added all the necessary CSS for the image comparison slider functionality:
- `.image-comparison-slider` - Prevents text selection during drag
- `.image-comparison-clipped` - Uses CSS `clip-path` with custom properties to show/hide the edited image
- `.image-comparison-handle` - Positions the slider handle using CSS custom properties
- `.slider-dragging` - Styles for when the user is dragging the slider
- `.slider-handle` - Styles for the visual handle including hover and active states

### 2. Fixed Handle Positioning (components/image-gallery.tsx)
- Added `transform: translateX(-50%)` to center the handle properly
- The handle now correctly follows the `--slider-position` CSS variable

### 3. Added Touch Support (components/image-gallery.tsx)
- Added `onTouchStart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` event handlers
- Now works on mobile devices and tablets

### 4. Added Slider Reset (components/image-gallery.tsx)
- When switching to slider mode, the position resets to 50% (center)
- Ensures consistent behavior when toggling between split and slider views

## How It Works

1. The slider uses CSS custom properties to control positioning:
   - `--slider-position`: Controls the handle position (0-100%)
   - `--clip-right`: Controls how much of the edited image is visible

2. The edited image is overlaid on top of the original using `position: absolute`

3. CSS `clip-path` is used to reveal only part of the edited image based on slider position

4. Mouse/touch events update the slider position, which updates the CSS variables

## Testing

1. Generate or upload an image
2. Edit the image with any prompt
3. In the image gallery, click on the edited image
4. Toggle between "Split" and "Slider" modes
5. In slider mode, drag the handle left/right to compare original vs edited

The slider should now work smoothly with visual feedback and proper positioning.
