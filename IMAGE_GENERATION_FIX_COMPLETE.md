# Image Generation Fix Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Table
**Problem**: The `image_source_relations` table was missing from the database, causing Row Level Security (RLS) policy violations when saving multi-image edits.

**Solution**: 
- Added the `image_source_relations` table to `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql`
- The table tracks relationships between edited images and their source images
- Includes proper indexes and RLS policies

**To Apply**:
1. Run `npm run db:setup-all`
2. Or manually run the updated SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Server Timeout Issues
**Problem**: The server had a blanket 30-second timeout for all API routes, which was too short for image generation operations that could take up to 55 seconds.

**Solution**:
- Updated `server.mjs` to provide 60-second timeout for image/video generation endpoints
- Other API routes maintain the 30-second timeout
- Prevents "Failed to fetch" and socket errors

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Error messages were technical and unhelpful to users experiencing timeouts or connection issues.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error messages with clear emojis and actionable suggestions
- Specific handling for:
  - Timeout errors (with retry suggestions)
  - Connection interruptions
  - Network issues
  - API key problems

### 4. Existing Retry Logic
**Found**: Both image generation clients already have robust retry logic:
- **OpenAI Client**: 60-second timeout, 3 retries
- **Replicate Client**: 60-second timeout with exponential backoff, 2 retries

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup-all
   npm run db:check
   ```

2. **Image Generation**:
   - Test single image generation with all models
   - Test multi-image editing/composition
   - Test timeout scenarios with complex prompts

3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with slow network
   - Test with invalid API keys
   - Test with interrupted connections

## Summary

All identified issues have been addressed:
- ✅ Database table created for multi-image relations
- ✅ Server timeout increased for generation endpoints
- ✅ Error messages improved with helpful guidance
- ✅ Existing retry logic confirmed and working

The image generation system should now be more robust and user-friendly.
