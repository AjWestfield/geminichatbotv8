# MCP Auto-Send Fix Complete - January 3, 2025

## Issue Description
The AI was automatically sending messages like "Okay, I understand the instructions..." when MCP tools were loaded. This happened without any user input, creating unwanted messages in the chat.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the MCP system prompt containing aggressive instructions that the AI interpreted as requiring acknowledgment:
- The prompt had commands like "You MUST use these tools"
- It ended with "Your response is INCOMPLETE and UNACCEPTABLE without proper analysis"
- The AI saw these instructions and automatically responded to acknowledge them

## Solution Applied
Modified the MCP system prompt generation in `lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added clear markers** to indicate this is system context:
   - Start: `[SYSTEM CONTEXT - DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OR RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE]`
   - End: `[END OF SYSTEM CONTEXT - DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THESE INSTRUCTIONS. WAIT FOR USER INPUT.]`

2. **Softened language** throughout:
   - Changed "You MUST use" â†’ "You have access to... that you can use"
   - Removed "INCOMPLETE and UNACCEPTABLE"
   - Converted commands to guidelines

3. **Reframed as capabilities** rather than instructions:
   - Tools are presented as available resources
   - Guidelines are suggestions, not requirements

## Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `/lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`
- **Method Updated**: `generateSystemPrompt()`
- **Lines Changed**: 89-187

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Open a new chat
3. Verify NO automatic "I understand the instructions" message appears
4. Test MCP tools still work by asking to use available tools
5. Confirm tools execute properly when requested

## Expected Behavior
- No automatic AI responses when starting a chat
- MCP tools remain fully functional
- AI waits for user input before responding
- Tool execution and analysis work as before

## Additional Notes
- The fix preserves all MCP functionality
- Tools are still discoverable and usable
- The AI will still analyze tool results appropriately
- No changes needed to the chat interface or API routes

The auto-send issue is now resolved!
