## How to Use the AI Agent for Social Media

### 1. Publishing Content

#### Basic Publishing Commands
Simply tell the AI what you want to post and where:

```
"Post this image to Instagram"
"Share this video on YouTube"
"Post to Facebook page LMG"
"Post this to all my social media"
```

#### Publishing with Captions
Include your desired caption in the request:

```
"Post this sunset photo to Instagram with caption 'Beautiful evening vibes #sunset'"
"Upload this video to YouTube with title 'Amazing Tutorial' and description 'Learn how to...'"
"Share on Facebook LMG page with message 'Check out our latest product!'"
```

#### Cross-Platform Publishing
The AI can adapt content for multiple platforms:

```
"Post this to all platforms"
"Share this video on YouTube and Instagram"
"Post to both Facebook pages"
```

### 2. Scheduling Content

You can schedule posts for specific times:

```
"Schedule this for tomorrow at 3pm on Instagram"
"Post this next Monday morning to Facebook"
"Schedule for peak hours on YouTube"
```

### 3. Content Optimization

The AI automatically optimizes content for each platform:

- **Image resizing** - Adapts images to platform requirements
- **Video trimming** - Cuts videos to platform limits
- **Caption optimization** - Adjusts text length and hashtags
- **Thumbnail generation** - Creates thumbnails for YouTube

### 4. Getting Post Information

Query your published content:

```
"Show my recent Instagram posts"
"Get analytics for last week's YouTube videos"
"Check performance of Facebook posts"
```
