# Zapier MCP Connection Reliability Fix

## Problem Summary

After a browser refresh, Zapier MCP tools were not displaying and the server was stuck in "connecting..." state. The root causes were:

1. **Initialization Race Condition**: The MCP initialization happened server-side but client state wasn't properly synchronized
2. **No Auto-reconnection**: Enabled servers weren't automatically reconnecting after page refresh
3. **State Persistence Mismatch**: The "enabled" state was persisted in localStorage but actual connections weren't re-established
4. **Missing Health Checks**: No mechanism to detect and recover from dropped connections

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Initialization Flow**
- Updated `/api/mcp/init` to return detailed connection state including tools and connection status
- The init endpoint now properly triggers auto-connection for servers like Zapier MCP

### 2. **Auto-connection Hook** (`use-mcp-auto-connect.ts`)
- Created a dedicated hook that runs on app startup
- Initializes MCP server manager and fetches server list
- Automatically connects servers that are marked as "enabled" in persisted state
- Ensures state synchronization between server and client

### 3. **Reconnection Service** (`mcp-reconnect-service.ts`)
- Implements exponential backoff retry logic
- Automatically attempts to reconnect critical servers like Zapier MCP on failure
- Maximum 3 retry attempts with increasing delays
- Prevents connection storms while ensuring reliability

### 4. **Connection Health Monitoring** (`use-mcp-connection-health.ts`)
- Periodic health checks every 30 seconds
- Verifies connected servers are still responsive
- Automatically reconnects unresponsive servers
- Prevents "zombie" connections

### 5. **Improved State Management**
- MCPToolsPopup now properly syncs connection state when opened
- Connection state updates are propagated correctly
- Removed redundant auto-connection logic from popup component

## How It Works Now

1. **On Page Load**:
   - `useMCPAutoConnect` initializes the MCP system
   - Fetches server configurations and connection states
   - Auto-connects any servers marked as "enabled" (like Zapier MCP)
   - Syncs the connection state with persisted preferences

2. **During Runtime**:
   - `useMCPConnectionHealth` monitors connection health
   - If a connection drops, the reconnection service attempts recovery
   - State is kept synchronized across all components

3. **On Failures**:
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Clear error messages in the UI
   - Graceful degradation without breaking the app

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/mcp/init/route.ts` - Enhanced initialization response
2. `/hooks/use-mcp-auto-connect.ts` - Auto-connection logic
3. `/lib/mcp/mcp-reconnect-service.ts` - Reconnection service
4. `/hooks/use-mcp-connection-health.ts` - Health monitoring
5. `/components/chat-interface.tsx` - Integration of new hooks
6. `/components/mcp/mcp-tools-popup.tsx` - Improved state sync
7. `/app/api/mcp/servers/[serverId]/tools/route.ts` - Health check endpoint

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Ensure Zapier MCP credentials are in `.env.local`
2. Start the app: `npm run dev`
3. Open the MCP Tools panel - Zapier should connect automatically
4. Refresh the browser - Zapier should reconnect within seconds
5. Check the console for connection logs

## Monitoring

Watch for these console messages:
- `[useMCPAutoConnect] Starting MCP initialization...`
- `[useMCPAutoConnect] Connecting enabled server: Zapier MCP`
- `[MCPConnectionHealth] Successfully reconnected Zapier MCP`

The system now ensures Zapier MCP (and other auto-connect servers) maintain their connection state reliably across browser refreshes and network interruptions.
