# Image Loading Fix

## Problem
After implementing the advanced image reliability system, all images were stuck in "Loading image..." state. The issue was caused by:

1. **Server-side imports in client hook**: The `useImageLoader` hook was trying to import `getImageByLocalId` from the database service, which only works server-side
2. **Complex async logic**: The hook had too many strategies and complex state management
3. **Missing timeouts**: No fallback if strategies took too long

## Solution
Created a simpler `SafeImage` component (`safe-image-simple.tsx`) that:

1. **Client-side only**: No server dependencies
2. **Simple fallback chain**: 
   - Try original URL
   - Try fallback URL if provided
   - Try proxy conversion for expired URLs
   - Show error with retry option
3. **5-second timeout**: Automatically shows the image after 5 seconds even if still "loading"
4. **Direct image rendering**: Always renders the `<img>` tag to let browser attempt loading

## Key Changes

### components/ui/safe-image-simple.tsx
- New simplified component without complex hooks
- Direct error handling with simple retry logic
- Timeout mechanism to prevent infinite loading

### components/image-gallery.tsx
- Updated to use `safe-image-simple` instead of `safe-image`
- All other SafeImage props remain the same

## Result
Images now load reliably with:
- Immediate display for working URLs
- Automatic fallback for expired URLs via proxy
- Clear error states with retry options
- No more infinite loading states

## Usage
The component works exactly like before:
```tsx
<SafeImage
  src={image.url}
  imageId={image.id}
  alt={image.prompt}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

## Next Steps
For production, consider:
- Implementing the full permanent storage solution server-side
- Adding service workers for offline caching
- Using Next.js Image component where appropriate for optimization
