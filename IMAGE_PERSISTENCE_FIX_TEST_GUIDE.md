# Image Persistence Fix - Test Guide

## What Was Fixed
The issue where uploaded images would disappear after a browser refresh has been fixed. The fix ensures that:

1. Uploaded images are properly saved to the database when persistence is enabled
2. If database save fails, uploaded images are kept in localStorage as a fallback
3. The system now distinguishes between uploaded images and generated images to prevent data loss

## How to Test the Fix

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Start your development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the app in your browser**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001 (or your configured port)

3. **Go to the Images tab**
   - Click on the "Images" tab in the right panel

4. **Upload an image**
   - Drag and drop an image into the gallery
   - Or use the file upload button if available

5. **Verify the image appears**
   - The image should appear in the gallery immediately

6. **Refresh the browser**
   - Press F5 or Cmd+R to refresh the page

7. **Check if the image persists**
   - Click on the "Images" tab again
   - The uploaded image should still be there

## Expected Results

✅ **Success**: The uploaded image remains in the gallery after refresh
❌ **Failure**: The uploaded image disappears after refresh

## What Changed

### In `loadPersistedImages`:
- Now keeps uploaded images from localStorage even when persistence is enabled
- Only removes non-uploaded images that are already in the database
- Prevents losing uploaded images that failed to save to the database

### In `handleCanvasFileUpload`:
- Ensures the correct chat ID is used when saving to database
- Updates the current chat ID state when a new chat is created
- Better logging to track the save process

## Troubleshooting

If images still disappear after refresh:

1. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
2. **Look for logs** starting with `[PAGE]` to trace the image loading process
3. **Verify persistence is configured** - check if you have database credentials set up
4. **Check localStorage** - open DevTools > Application > Local Storage and look for saved images

## Additional Notes

- Uploaded images are marked with `isUploaded: true` to distinguish them from generated images
- The system now maintains uploaded images in localStorage as a safety net
- Database persistence is preferred but not required for uploaded images to persist
