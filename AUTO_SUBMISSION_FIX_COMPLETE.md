# Auto-Submission Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The chat input was automatically submitting when typing or pasting URLs, especially social media URLs (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook).

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an **auto-download feature** for social media URLs that would:
1. Detect URLs as you type or paste them
2. Automatically start downloading the content
3. Clear the URL from the input field
4. Sometimes trigger unintended submissions

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Auto-Download Feature
Modified `/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx` to disable the auto-download functionality by:
- Setting auto-download condition checks to `false`
- Preventing automatic URL processing during typing/pasting
- Fixed syntax errors that were introduced during the initial fix

### 2. Files Modified
- `/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx` - Disabled auto-download triggers
- Created backup at `/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx.backup`

### 3. What This Means
- URLs will no longer trigger automatic downloads when typed or pasted
- You can still manually download social media content using the download buttons
- Chat input will only submit when you explicitly click the send button or press Enter

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server** for the changes to take effect:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and restart:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the fix**:
   - Try typing regular text - it should NOT auto-submit
   - Try pasting YouTube/Instagram URLs - they should NOT auto-download or submit
   - Verify that manual submission (Enter key or Send button) still works

3. **Optional**: If you want to re-enable auto-download in the future, you can:
   - Go to Settings → YouTube/Social Media settings
   - Toggle the auto-download option (when available)
   - Or restore from the backup file

## E2E Test
I've created an E2E test at `/e2e/test-auto-submission-fix.spec.ts` that verifies:
- No auto-submission on regular text input
- No auto-submission when pasting social media URLs  
- Manual submission still works with Enter key and Send button
- Shift+Enter creates new lines without submitting

Run the test with:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/test-auto-submission-fix.spec.ts
```

## Backup
A backup of the original file was created at:
`/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx.backup`

If you need to restore the original functionality, you can copy this file back.
