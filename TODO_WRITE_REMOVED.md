# TodoWrite Functionality Completely Removed

## Problem
The AI was still outputting TodoWrite task lists even after disabling the functionality. Example:
```
Tasks:
1. TodoWrite: (pending) Find or generate an airplane window view image...
2. TodoWrite: (pending) Find or generate an image of human feet...
...
Tasks created and awaiting approval.
```

## Root Cause
The AI had been trained/prompted with TodoWrite patterns and was continuing to use them even after the instructions were commented out.

## Solution - Complete Removal

### 1. Removed Task Instructions
- Removed the agent task instructions that told AI to use TodoWrite
- Added explicit instruction to NOT use TodoWrite or task lists

### 2. Removed Task Processing
- Commented out the task middleware that parsed TodoWrite patterns
- Removed imports for task-related modules

### 3. Added Anti-TodoWrite Instruction
Added explicit instruction in `/app/api/chat/route.ts`:
```javascript
contentParts.push({
  text: `IMPORTANT: Do NOT use TodoWrite, task lists, or any task management syntax in your responses. Simply respond directly to the user's request without creating task lists or planning steps.`
})
```

## Changes Made

### `/app/api/chat/route.ts`
1. Removed imports:
   - `import { defaultOrchestrator } from "@/lib/workflows/orchestrator"`
   - `import { getTaskMiddleware } from "./task-middleware"`
   - `import { useAgentTaskStore } from "@/lib/stores/agent-task-store"`

2. Replaced task instructions with anti-TodoWrite instruction (line 841-843)

3. Removed task middleware processing code (lines 1040-1091)

## Result
The AI will now:
- ✅ Respond directly to requests without creating task lists
- ✅ Not use TodoWrite syntax
- ✅ Not create "pending" tasks
- ✅ Not say "Tasks created and awaiting approval"

## Testing
Try asking the AI to "Create a funny meme image" - it should respond normally without any task lists.
