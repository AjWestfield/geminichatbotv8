# Video Error Fix Complete

## Summary

The video playback error has been fixed. The core issue was that Gemini file URIs cannot be played directly in video elements - they're API endpoints that return metadata, not video content.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Video Proxy Approach
The video proxy was trying to fetch video content from Gemini, but Gemini returns JSON metadata instead:
```javascript
// This returns JSON, not video:
fetch('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/xyz')
// Response: { "name": "files/xyz", "mimeType": "video/mp4", ... }
```

### 2. Updated FilePreviewModal Logic
```javascript
// Now checks for playable URLs first
if (file.url && !file.url.startsWith('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/')) {
  videoSrc = file.url; // Use blob or regular URL
} else if ((file as any).geminiFileUri) {
  isGeminiOnly = true; // Flag that we only have Gemini URI
  videoSrc = ''; // Don't try to play it
}
```

### 3. Added Clear User Messaging
When a video only has a Gemini URI, users now see:
> "This video is stored on Gemini AI and cannot be played directly. Use the Analyze or Reverse Engineer buttons below to work with this video."

### 4. Enhanced Error Logging
The empty error object `{}` issue was fixed by properly structuring the error details:
```javascript
const errorDetails = {
  videoSrc,
  errorCode: error?.code || 'unknown',
  errorMessage: error?.message || 'No error message',
  readyState: videoElement.readyState,
  networkState: videoElement.networkState,
  currentSrc: videoElement.currentSrc
};
```

## How Videos Work Now

1. **With Blob URL** (can play):
   - User uploads video → Creates blob URL → Can play in modal
   
2. **Gemini Only** (can't play):
   - Video from social media → Only has Gemini URI → Shows explanation
   - User can still Analyze or Reverse Engineer the video

## Testing

1. Upload a video file from your computer → Should play normally
2. Paste a TikTok/YouTube URL → Video uploads but shows "stored on Gemini AI" message
3. Both scenarios allow Analyze/Reverse Engineer functionality

## Key Takeaway

Gemini file URIs are for AI processing only, not direct playback. The app now handles this gracefully with clear messaging and alternative actions.
